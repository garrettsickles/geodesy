# geodesy
EGM (Earth Gravity Model), LLA (Geodetic), ECEF (Geocentric), WGS84 (Ellipsoid), and more!

I have three goals for this project:
1. Document the use of the NGA Office of Geomatics source artifacts for EGM, WMM, and WGS84.
2. Add C software library support for common operations like undulation interpolation and coordinate transformations.
3. Optimize for performance using all available methods and tools.
